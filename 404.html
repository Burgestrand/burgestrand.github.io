    <h1>This document is missing</h1>
    <p>
      I couldn't find the page you were looking for. Some links have moved recently,
      so you might have better luck changing the URL to
      <a href="http://burgestrand.se/" id="url">burgestrand.se/articles/&lt;post title></a>
    </p>
    <h2>Still can’t find it?</h2>
    <p>
      Then it’s likely that it has vanished into oblivion and will never be found.
      My main page still remains at <a href="http://burgestrand.se/">burgestrand.se/</a>
      though, so all is not lost.
