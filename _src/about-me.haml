    I’m a Swedish developer, brought up on an island named [Resarö][] in the
    Stockholm archipelago. I currently live with my girlfriend Elin in Gothenburg,
    where I work at this awesome lil' place called [Elabs](http://elabs.se/).

    I try to avoid defining myself as a programmer. I do enjoy creating things, and
    code just happens to be one of the ways I do it with. Here’s some cody thingies
    I’ve made:

    [Hallon](https://github.com/Burgestrand/Hallon)
    : Ruby bindings for the official [Spotify](http://spotify.com) API.

    [Dimma](https://github.com/Burgestrand/Dimma)
    : A ruby library for the [Beacon](http://beaconpush.com/) REST API.

    [vlad-nginx](https://github.com/Burgestrand/vlad-nginx)
    : NGiNX recipe for Vlad the Deployer.

    [radiofy.se](http://beta.radiofy.se/) <small>(co-developer)</small>
    : A website built around a service where we aggregate data from Swedish radio
      stations and put their music into (automatically updated) Spotify playlists
      grouped by channel. <small>(built using ruby on rails)</small>
