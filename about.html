<p>
  I’m a Swedish developer, brought up on an island named <a href="http://bit.ly/aPtQxr">Resarö</a> in the Stockholm archipelago.
  For almost five years I worked in Gothenburg at a little place called
  <a href="http://elabs.se/">Elabs</a>, but in 2016 I decided to move back to
  Stockholm since I missed my friends &amp; family.

  My girlfriend Elin and I now live happily in Stockholm, out in the
  woods in Blackeberg. I still work as a developer, and quite enjoy
  it. Whenever I can I will wakeboard, snowboard, play computer games,
  and juggle — however not at the same time.
