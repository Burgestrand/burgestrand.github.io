  <p>
    I’m a self-taught Swedish developer, brought up on an island named <a href="http://bit.ly/aPtQxr">Resarö</a> in the Stockholm archipelago.
    My history includes a short visit to Jönköping University where I met my partner Elin, a pit stop at Gothenburg University, and then roughly five years as a developer at <a href="https://www.varvet.com/">Elabs (Varvet since 2016)</a>.

    In 2016 Elin and I moved to Stockholm to get closer to family. Today we live happily out in the woods of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_the_Right_One_In_(novel)">Blackeberg</a>, Stockholm.
    I continue to work as a developer and founder of a small consumer-app company; and whenever I can I will wakeboard, snowboard,
    play computer games, and juggle.
