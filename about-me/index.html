<p>
  I’m a self-taught Swedish developer, brought up on an island named <a href="http://bit.ly/aPtQxr">Resarö</a> in the Stockholm archipelago.
  My history includes a small detour to meet my spouse Elin in Jönköping, a flyby of Jönköping University, a short pit stop at Gothenburg University, and roughly five years as a developer at <a href="http://elabs.se/">Elabs</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Today Elin and I live happily out in the woods of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_the_Right_One_In_(novel)">Blackeberg</a>, Stockholm.
  I still work as a developer (now with <a href="https://sqore.com/">Sqore</a>) and whenever I can I will wakeboard, snowboard,
  play computer games, and juggle — however not at all the same time.
