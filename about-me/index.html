  <p>
    I’m a self-taught Swedish developer and grew up on an island named <a href="http://maps.apple.com/?address=Resarö,+Vaxholm,+Sweden&t=m">Resarö</a> in the Stockholm archipelago.
    My history includes a short visit to Jönköping University where I met my partner Elin, a pit stop at Gothenburg University, and then roughly five years as a developer at <a href="https://www.varvet.com/">Elabs (Varvet since 2016)</a>.

  <p>
    In 2016, Elin and I moved to Stockholm to get closer to family. For a
    while we lived happily out in the woods of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_the_Right_One_In_(novel)">Blackeberg</a>,
    but in the summer of 2019 we packed our things and moved out into the archipelago again, to <a href="http://maps.apple.com/?address=Rindö,+Vaxholm,+Sweden&t=m">Rindö</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I continue to work as a developer, and today I am a co-founder &amp; partner of a small
    digital agency named <a href="https://www.varvet.com">Varvet</a>. Other than that I enjoy
    a multitude of things such as computer games, board games, woodworking, horse riding, martial arts,
    snowboarding, wakeboarding, juggling, and so on.

    I'm also a dad. Together we explore the wonderful world we live in.
