Translated from Swedish.

Today's the first time I'm doing something like this, but it might be closer
to my heart than usual now that I have a small boy of my own to care for.

Today is international men's day.

* You shouldn't have to feel bad about enjoying pink cocktails, spice girls, manicure, lace embroidery, and sex and the city.
* You shouldn't have to feel bad about enjoying colorful clothing.
* You shouldn't have to feel bad about enjoying color and glitter.
* You shouldn't have to feel as if you need to be aggressive.
* You shouldn't have to feel as if you need to be tough.
* You shouldn't have to feel that you must drink a rough whiskey, smoke cigar, and eat copious amounts of bacon.
* It should not be unmanly to pull your own weight at home; to do the dishes, clean, cook, and take care of your kids.

This kind of shit is bad, repressive. It forces people to feel like shit. Drives them to suicide. Lung cancer, alcohol poisoning, obesity. They die in traffic accidents. They get assaulted. Distant and cold.

Alone. Depressed. Miserable.

It has to be OK to show weakness, to cry, to need help. It has to.

Manliness is real. It's a good thing. It'd be nice if it was only a good thing.
