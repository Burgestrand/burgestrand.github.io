title: Nordic Ruby bann… I mean ribbons!

The Nordic Ruby guys recently [wrote a blog post about adding their banners to your site](http://nordicruby.org/news#post_8). I liked the idea, but the provided banners did not fit anywhere into my site design. Even if I consider myself aestethically handicapped (I avoid any kind of graphics design), I had to overcome this minor speed bump somehow.

So I hacked away at it. First I had a CSS only implementation, then switched to an image version because of font rendering issues with windows (meh…) but finally settled with the version I have now:

- [Ribbon background image from Nordic Ruby](http://nordicruby.org/)
- [Fertigo Pro Regular font from exljbris](http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/fertigo-pro/regular/)
- and of course, the awesomeness of [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) for CSS3 effects such as rotation and shadows

Keep in mind I don’t do *anything* for cross-browser compatibility. Users of old and inferior browsers will not be getting any bling bling from me.
