excerpt: Some days it will be hard keeping motivation up and procrastination will be a common resort. A Seinfeld Calendar is what some have used to keep their brains focused, and here’s my twist of it.

[Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret) is where I first saw the notion of a “Seinfeld Calendar”:

> He revealed a unique calendar system he uses to pressure himself to write. Here's how it works.
> 
> He told me to get a big wall calendar that has a whole year on one page and hang it on a prominent wall. The next step was to get a big red magic marker.
> 
> He said for each day that I do my task of writing, I get to put a big red X over that day. "After a few days you'll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You'll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain."
> 
> "Don't break the chain," he said again for emphasis.

My idea is simple: add doing something you **want** to do as an additional requirement to what you *should* do, before you can mark your day X’ed. I think both tasks are equally important.
