      <p>
        I’m a self-taught Swedish developer and grew up on an island named
        <a href="http://maps.apple.com/?address=Resarö,+Vaxholm,+Sweden&t=m"
          >Resarö</a
        > in the Stockholm archipelago. My history includes a short visit to Jönköping
        University where I met my partner Elin, a pit stop at Gothenburg University,
        and then roughly five years as a developer at <a
          href="https://www.varvet.com/">Elabs (Varvet since 2016)</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2016, Elin and I moved to Stockholm to get closer to family. For a
        while we lived happily out in the woods of <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_the_Right_One_In_(novel)"
          >Blackeberg</a
        >, while I ran a startup in the consumer mobile space.
      </p>

      <p>
        Late 2018 my son was born, and in the following summer we packed our
        things and moved out into the archipelago, to a small ex-military island
        known <a
          href="http://maps.apple.com/?address=Rindö,+Vaxholm,+Sweden&t=m"
          >Rindö</a
        >. Things were great, and then the pandemic hit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Long story short, since 2020 I am a <a href="https://kim.varvet.com"
          >co-founder & partner</a
        >
        of a small rebooted digital agency named <a
          href="https://www.varvet.com/">Varvet</a
        >. We spend our time building beautiful and useful digital services,
        like websites and apps.
      </p>

      <p>In 2021 my daughter was born.</p>

      <p>
        When I do have some free time I enjoy far too many things to list, and
        the hobbies keep piling up. I'm a maker of things, karate instructor,
        juggler, computer gamer, snowboarder, and community builder. I <a
          href="https://github.com/Burgestrand/V1.324">built a 3D printer</a
        >, <a href="https://github.com/MillenniumMachines/Milo-v1.5"
          >a CNC mill</a
        >, <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_view_(radio_control)"
          >an FPV freestyle drone</a
        >, and I <a href="https://www.rindögården.se">help run a fritidsgård</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        All of that, and what's absolutely most important to me is my family.
